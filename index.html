                    <p>Federal spending as a share of GDP hovered around 21–22% from 1975 to 2015, reflecting a stable post-WWII norm. The 2020 spike to 33% (COVID) was temporary, but the 2025 level of 23.9% is still 10% above the 50-year average and represents $6.9 trillion in annual extraction from the private economy. Every percentage point equals ~$280 billion in taxes or debt — money not available for voluntary exchange.</p>
                    <p>The rise since 2015 is driven by entitlement auto-pilot (Social Security, Medicare) and interest on debt, not new discretionary programs. This metric is worsening because Congress refuses structural reform — and the 2025 Trump cuts (via DOGE) have only trimmed $170B, not enough to reverse the trend.</p>

                    <p>In 1975, 6% of GDP went directly to individuals via cash or in-kind benefits. By 2025, this is 15% — $4.3 trillion annually. Medicare and Medicaid grew fastest due to aging population + medical inflation, while "Others" (SNAP, EITC, UI, housing) exploded post-2008 and 2020. This is not investment — it's consumption funded by debt or taxes.</p>
                    <p>This metric is worsening dramatically because entitlements are on auto-pilot: no means-testing, no sunset clauses. Even Trump's 2025 cuts barely touched these programs. Impact: 1 in 3 households now receives direct federal cash, eroding work incentives and political resistance to tax hikes.</p>

                    <p>This is worsening because no administration has repealed more than it added long-term. Impact: A small business must navigate thousands of pages just to operate legally — a barrier to entry that protects incumbents.</p>
